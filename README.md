**Notes**

The UrbanAirshipCLI class will be removed from the project and used as the new 
shipping README as demo code. As it stands, it is a demo for how the library works.

Attempted to follow the guidelines outlined here: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards

This git history will be dumped before shipping, application keys and
secrets have been committed to the repo during development.

This README will be edited before shipping.

Feedback is much appreciated.
